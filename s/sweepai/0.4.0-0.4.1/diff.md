 2. Copy the üîµ blue 8-digit code from your terminal into the page. You should only need to do the authentication once.  
     - Wait a few seconds and Sweep Chat will start.

 Github App Setting up Sweep is as simple as adding the GitHub bot to a repo,
 then creating an issue for the bot to address. We support all languages GPT4
 supports, including Python, Typescript, Rust, Go, Java, C# and C++. 1. Add the
 [Sweep GitHub app](https://github.com/apps/sweep-ai) to desired repos 2. Create
 new issue in repo, like "Sweep: Write tests" 3. Watch the magic happen √∞¬ü¬™¬Ñ ##

Each task required us to open our IDE to fix simple bugs. So we decided to leverage the capabilities of ChatGPT to address this directly in GitHub.\n\nUnlike existing AI solutions, this can solve entire tickets and can be parallelized + asynchronous: developers can spin up 10 tickets and Sweep will address them all at once.\n\n## üìö The Stack\n- GPT-4 32k 0613 (default)\n- ActiveLoop DeepLake for Vector DB with MiniLM L12 as our embeddings model\n- Modal Labs for infra + deployment\n- Gradio for Sweep Chat\n\n## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap\nSee [üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap](https://docs.sweep.dev/roadmap)\n\n## ‚≠ê Star History\n\n[![Star History Chart](https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=sweepai/sweep&type=Date)](https://star-history.com/#sweepai/sweep&Date)\n\nConsider starring us if you\'re using Sweep so more people hear about us!\n<h2 align="center">\n    Contributors\n</h2>\n<p align="center">\n    Thank you for your contribution!\n</p>\n<p align="center">\n    <a href="https://github.com/sweepai/sweep/graphs/contributors">\n      <img src="https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=sweepai/sweep" />\n    </a>\n</p>\n<p align="center">\n    and, of course, Sweep!\n</p>\n',
