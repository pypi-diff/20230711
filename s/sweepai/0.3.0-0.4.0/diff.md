 ## üöÄ Getting Started
 
+### üç≤ Recipes
+#### To get the best performance from Sweep, we recommend the following approach to writing github issues/chats. 
+For harder problems, try to provide the same information a human would need. For simpler problems, providing a single line and a file name should suffice.
+
+A good issue might include:
+
+| Where to look <br> **[file name or function name]**| What to do <br> **[change the logic to do this]** | Additional Context (optional) <br> **[there's a bug/we need this feature/there's this dependency]** |
+|-----------|------------|----------------------|
+|In `sweepai/app/ui.py`|use an os-agnostic temp directory|N/A|
+|In `on_comment.py`|we should not fire an event|because it's possible that the comment is on a closed PR|
+|In the config loader in `packages/server/src/config.ts`|add a third option called "env" to load the config settings from environment variables| At present, there are two options:  1. ... and 2. ...|
+
+If you want Sweep to use a file, try to mention the full path. Similarly, to have Sweep use a function, try to mention the class method or what it does. Also see [‚ú® Tips and tricks for Sweep](https://docs.sweep.dev/tricks).
+
 ### üñ•Ô∏è Sweep Chat
-Sweep Chat allows you to interact with Sweep locally and will sync with GitHub. You can plan out your changes with Sweep, and then Sweep can create a pull request for you.

 ### ‚ú® Sweep Github App
 Setting up Sweep is as simple as adding the GitHub bot to a repo, then creating an issue for the bot to address.
+We support all languages GPT4 supports, including Python, Typescript, Rust, Go, Java, C# and C++.
 
 1. Add the [Sweep GitHub app](https://github.com/apps/sweep-ai) to desired repos
 2. Create new issue in repo, like "Sweep: Write tests"
-3. "üëÄ" means it is taking a look, and it will generate the desired code
-4. "üöÄ" means the bot has finished its job and created a PR
+3. Watch the magic happen ü™Ñ

 ## üìò Story
 
-We were frustrated by small tickets, like simple bug fixes, annoying refactors, and small features, each task requiring us to open our IDE to fix simple bugs. So, we decided to leverage the capabilities of ChatGPT to address this directly in GitHub.

-Unlike existing AI solutions, this can solve entire tickets and can be parallelized: developers can spin up 10 tickets and Sweep will address them all at once.

Similarly, to have Sweep use a function, try to mention the class method or what it does. Also see [‚ú® Tips and tricks for Sweep](https://docs.sweep.dev/tricks).\n\n### üñ•Ô∏è Sweep Chat\nSweep Chat allows you to interact with Sweep and GitHub locally.

+recommend the following approach to writing github issues/chats. \nFor harder
+problems, try to provide the same information a human would need. For simpler
+problems, providing a single line and a file name should suffice.\n\nA good
+issue might include:\n\n| Where to look
+**[file name or function name]**| What to do
+**[change the logic to do this]** | Additional Context (optional)
+**[there\'s a bug/we need this feature/there\'s this dependency]** |\n|--------
+---|------------|----------------------|\n|In `sweepai/app/ui.py`|use an os-
+agnostic temp directory|N/A|\n|In `on_comment.py`|we should not fire an
+event|because it\'s possible that the comment is on a closed PR|\n|In the
+config loader in `packages/server/src/config.ts`|add a third option called
+"env" to load the config settings from environment variables| At present, there
+are two options: 1. ... and 2. ...|\n\nIf you want Sweep to use a file, try to
+mention the full path. Similarly, to have Sweep use a function, try to mention
+the class method or what it does. Also see [√¢¬ú¬® Tips and tricks for Sweep]
+(https://docs.sweep.dev/tricks).\n\n### √∞¬ü¬ñ¬•√Ø¬∏¬è Sweep Chat\nSweep Chat allows
+you to interact with Sweep and GitHub locally. Collaborate on the plan with
+Sweep, then have it create the pull request for you. \n\n**Prerequisites:**
+Install [Sweep GitHub app](https://github.com/apps/sweep-ai) to your
+repository\n\n1. Run `pip install sweepai && sweep`. Note that you need
+**python 3.10+.**\n - This runs GitHub authentication in your browser. \n\n2.
+Copy the √∞¬ü¬î¬µ blue 8-digit code from your terminal into the page. You should
+only need to do the authentication once. \n - Wait a few seconds and Sweep Chat
+will start. \n\n3. Choose a repository from the dropdown at the top (the Github
+app must be installed to this repository).\n\n - √¢¬ö¬° Start chatting with Sweep
+Chat! √¢¬ö¬°\n\n[https://github.com/sweepai/sweep/blob/
+856ff66c2dbeaf39afbf6d8c49a620dfa70271fb/.assets/gradio-
+screenshot.png]\n\nTips:\n* √∞¬ü¬î¬ç Relevant searched files will show up on the
+right. \n* √∞¬ü¬î¬ò Sweep Chat creates PRs when the "Create PR" button is clicked.
+\n* √∞¬ü¬í¬° You can force dark mode by going to http://127.0.0.1:7861/
+?__theme=dark.\n\n#### From Source\nIf you want the nightly build and or if the
+latest build has issues.\n\n1. `git clone https://github.com/sweepai/sweep &&
+poetry install`\n2. `python sweepai/app/cli.py`. Note that you need **python
+3.10+**.\n\n### √¢¬ú¬® Sweep Github App\nSetting up Sweep is as simple as adding
+the GitHub bot to a repo, then creating an issue for the bot to address.\nWe
+support all languages GPT4 supports, including Python, Typescript, Rust, Go,
+Java, C# and C++.\n\n1. Add the [Sweep GitHub app](https://github.com/apps/
+sweep-ai) to desired repos\n2. Create new issue in repo, like "Sweep: Write
+tests"\n3. Watch the magic happen √∞¬ü¬™¬Ñ\n\n## √∞¬ü¬§¬ù Contributing\n\nContributions

+Story\n\nWe were frustrated by small tickets, like simple bug fixes, annoying
+refactors, and small features. Each task required us to open our IDE to fix
+simple bugs. So we decided to leverage the capabilities of ChatGPT to address

+interact with Sweep and GitHub locally. Collaborate on the plan with Sweep,
+then have it create the pull request for you. **Prerequisites:** Install [Sweep
+GitHub app](https://github.com/apps/sweep-ai) to your repository 1. Run `pip
+install sweepai && sweep`. Note that you need **python 3.10+.** - This runs
+GitHub authentication in your browser. 2. Copy the √∞¬ü¬î¬µ blue 8-digit code from
+your terminal into the page. You should only need to do the authentication
+once. - Wait a few seconds and Sweep Chat will start. 3. Choose a repository
+from the dropdown at the top (the Github app must be installed to this
+repository). - √¢¬ö¬° Start chatting with Sweep Chat! √¢¬ö¬° [https://github.com/
+sweepai/sweep/blob/856ff66c2dbeaf39afbf6d8c49a620dfa70271fb/.assets/gradio-

-`python sweepai/app/cli.py`. Note that you need python 3.10 or greater. ### √¢¬ú¬®
-Sweep Github App Setting up Sweep is as simple as adding the GitHub bot to a
-repo, then creating an issue for the bot to address. 1. Add the [Sweep GitHub
-app](https://github.com/apps/sweep-ai) to desired repos 2. Create new issue in
-repo, like "Sweep: Write tests" 3. "√∞¬ü¬ë¬Ä" means it is taking a look, and it
-will generate the desired code 4. "√∞¬ü¬ö¬Ä" means the bot has finished its job and
-created a PR ## √∞¬ü¬§¬ù Contributing Contributions are welcome and greatly
-appreciated! For detailed guidelines on how to contribute, please see the
-[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file. In essence, you'll need to fork the
-repository, create a new branch for your feature or bug fix, commit your
-changes, and open a pull request. For more detailed docs, see [√∞¬ü¬ö¬Ä Quickstart]
-(https://docs.sweep.dev/start). --- ## √∞¬ü¬ì¬ò Story We were frustrated by small
-tickets, like simple bug fixes, annoying refactors, and small features, each
-task requiring us to open our IDE to fix simple bugs. So, we decided to
-leverage the capabilities of ChatGPT to address this directly in GitHub. Unlike
-existing AI solutions, this can solve entire tickets and can be parallelized:
