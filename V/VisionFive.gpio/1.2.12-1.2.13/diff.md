+# Project description
 
-This package provides a Python module to control the GPIO on a VisionFive.
+This package provides a Python module to control the GPIO on a VisionFive SBC.
 
-Support basic GPIO function including edge detection, I2C API, PWM API, SPI API。
+Support basic GPIO function including I/O, edge detection, PWM, I2C, SPI. Although hardware PWM is not available yet, software PWM is available to use on all channels.
 
+# Installation
+There are two ways to install VisionFive.gpio:
+## pip:
+a. First, access the following website to check the latest version number of VisionFive.gpio:
+https://pypi.org/project/VisionFive.gpio/#history
+b. Replace "1.x.x" in the following URL with the latest version number obtained from the above step:
+https://pypi.org/project/VisionFive.gpio/1.x.x/#files
+c. Visit the modified URL, for example:
+https://pypi.org/project/VisionFive.gpio/1.2.12/#files
+d. Hover over the file with the ".whl" extension (e.g., VisionFive.gpio-1.2.12-cp34-abi3-any.whl) and right-click to copy the link address.
+e. Download the .whl installation package using the wget command:
+wget download_address_of_whl_package
+f. Rename the .whl package by replacing "any" with "linux_riscv64":
+mv VisionFive.gpio-1.2.12-cp34-abi3-any.whl VisionFive.gpio-1.2.12-cp34-abi3-linux_riscv64.whl
+g. Finally, install the .whl package using the following command:
+pip install VisionFive.gpio-1.2.12-cp34-abi3-any.whl
+## script:
+You can use the method provided in the following URL to install the script: https://doc-en.rvspace.org/VisionFive2/AN_Edge_Detection/VisionFive2_ApplicationNotes/Shared_preparing_software%20-%20vf2.html
+
+# Usage
+Same as RPi.GPIO, help and usage of APIs can be obtained through help() API:
+```
+import VisionFive.gpio as GPIO
+help(GPIO)
+help(GPIO.setup)
+```
+# Sample Code
 Support python sample, such as:
 - GPIO basic operation including input and output
 - Sense HAT(B) basing I2C API
 - LED_Matrix to display logo about Starfive
 - uart_gps_demo to read gps information from GPS NEO-6M
 - pwm_led to test PWM module works well
 - edge_detection_basic about basic edge API usage
 - edge_with_waiting_time about edge detection with specific time
 - edge_with_LED_Matrix about trigger LED display by button
 - RPi_demo_#GPIO_basic#_run_on_VisionFive about running RPi GPIO demo on VisionFive board
 - RPi_demo_#PWM#_run_on_VisionFive about running RPi PWM demo on VisionFive board
